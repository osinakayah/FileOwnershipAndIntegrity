# FileOwnershipAndIntegrity
My very first smart contract
This contract prove file ownership without displaying the actual file, it also proves that a particular file existed at a particular time and that it was not modified or tampered with.
The node client to test the contract can be found on https://github.com/osinakayah/FileOwnershipAndIntegrityClient
It was built and deployed using truffle
